# OrbitalMechanics
Performed hyperparameterization of orbital mechanics using C, MPI, and Gnuplot. 10/18/19 - 1/17/20

Lab07 - Analyzed trajectory of spaceship launched from Earth in circular, elliptical, and hyperbolic orbits and plotted distance and speed over time. 10/18/19 - 10/25/19

Lab08 - Found angle for a free return trajectory of spacecraft launched from Earth and indicated interaction with moon during return. Graphed trajectory and speed of Apollo over time. 10/25/19 - 11/22/19

Lab09 - Found initial speed and angle needed to maximize exit speed of probe launched from Earth towards a deep space target and flying behind the moon in an extreme hyperbolic trajectory. Plotted hyperbolic trajectory, distance from probe to move over time, and speed of probe over time. 11/22/19 - 12/18/19

Lab10 - Investigated pairs of speed and angle parameters to characterize the outcome of the run from the probe launching from the Earth-moon system. Found pair of parameters to maximize exit speed by splitting pairs across multiple workers using MPI. 12/18/19 - 1/17/20
